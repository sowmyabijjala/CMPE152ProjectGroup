A minimally acceptable compiler project has at least these features:
• Two data types with type checking.
• Basic arithmetic operations with operator precedence.
• Assignment statements.
• A conditional control statement (e.g., IF).
• A looping control statement.
• Procedures or functions with calls and returns.
• Parameters passed by value or by reference.
• Basic syntax error recovery (skip to semicolon or end of line).
• Nontrivial sample programs written in the source language.
• Generate Jasmin assembly code that can be successfully assembled.
• Execute the resulting .class file.
• No crashes (e.g., null pointer exceptions).

Each team will write a report (5-10 pp.) that includes:
• A high-level description of the design of the compiler with UML diagrams of the major
classes.
• The grammar for your source language, either as syntax diagrams or in BNF.
• Code templates that show the Jasmin code your compiler generates for some key
constructs of the source language.

## Team Compiler Project Requirements 

• Invent a new programming language or choose a subset of an existing language.

• Develop a grammar for the language.

• Generate a compiler for the language using the ANTLR compiler-compiler. You may
borrow other components from the compiler code given in the class.

A minimally acceptable compiler project has at least these features:

• Two data types with type checking.

• Basic arithmetic operations with operator precedence.

• Assignment statements.

• A conditional control statement (e.g., IF).

• A looping control statement.

• Procedures or functions with calls and returns.

• Parameters passed by value or by reference.

• Basic syntax error recovery (skip to semicolon or end of line).

• Nontrivial sample programs written in the source language.

• Generate Jasmin assembly code that can be successfully assembled.

• Execute the resulting .class file.

• No crashes (e.g., null pointer exceptions).
